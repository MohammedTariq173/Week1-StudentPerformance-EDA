# Week1-StudentPerformance-EDA
About the Dataset:
I used the popular Students Performance in Exams dataset from Kaggle. It contains details such as:

Student gender

Parental level of education

Lunch type (standard or free/reduced)

Test preparation course status

Scores in math, reading, and writing

Check it out on Kaggle

What I Set Out to Do:

Load and explore the dataset with pandas

Use grouping and averaging to compare scores across different categories

Visualize trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Draw clear insights and summarize findings

Document the whole process cleanly in a Jupyter Notebook

Key Takeaways from the Analysis:

1.Students who completed the test preparation course tend to score higher across all subjects.

2.Female students outperform males in reading and writing, while males have a slight edge in math.

3.Those with a standard lunch scored better than students with free or reduced lunch.

4.Higher parental education levels are linked to better student scores.

5.Thereâ€™s a strong positive correlation between reading and writing scores.

Tools I Used:
Python (Jupyter Notebook), 
Pandas for data handling,
Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization
